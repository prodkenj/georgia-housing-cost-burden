## Introduction

    The Carl Vinson Institute of Government (CVIOG) at the University of
Georgia provides research, consulting, and training services to
Georgia's state and local governments. It attempts to support policy
development and decision-making by providing data-driven insights to
help improve public services and the well-being of Georgia residents.
But, according to a 2023 article by Chris Dowd, there is one such
problem compromising the well-being of Georgia residents: housing
insecurity (Dowd, 2023).

    According to Dowd, in Athens, more than half of its residents are
housing burdened, spending more than 30% of their income on housing. For
those earning minimum wage or close to minimum wage, the situation is
much more dire; they must rely on low-income housing options such as
Section 8. This is not only an issue of supply, but an issue of
corporate greed. GA Code 44-7-19, passed in 1981, prohibits counties and
municipalities from enacting rent control, effectively allowing
landlords to raise rents without limits(Georgia Code, 2024, § 44-7-19).

    Consequently, since the 2008 housing crash, hedge funds and private
equity investors have been buying up starter homes and apartments,
especially in Atlanta and other big cities, leaving properties vacant to
appreciate in value or to be transformed into "luxury rentals" (Perry,
2023). In metro Atlanta alone, these bulk buyers have accumulated more
than 65,000 single-family homes over the past decade, with 11 companies
owning over 1,000 homes each.

    Even though these corporate buyers did not create the housing
crisis, they greatly exacerbated it. Metro Atlanta home values rose
across the board from 2012 to 2022. The same analysis found that they
climbed more sharply in places where investors bought more houses. In
fact, in the 30 ZIP codes with the most investor-owned properties, home
values appreciated at nearly twice the annual rate as the 30 ZIP codes
where investors own the least. As of this writing, the six largest
single-family rental firms own 63% of the homes in metro Atlanta.

## Project Focus

    The goal of this study is to analyze the housing burden in Georgia
by investigating the demographic, economic, and geographic features that
contribute to the challenges of housing affordability and access.
Specifically, we will examine how factors such as income, race,
education, and location influence housing affordability and access
across the state. Understanding these relationships will inform policies
with the goal of improving housing affordability and accessibility
across the state of Georgia. This project is being conducted in
collaboration with the CVIOG, who concentrate on improving the
effectiveness of government through research and analysis. Our findings
will help CVIOG support local governments and communities across Georgia
in addressing the housing burden crisis.

## Research Questions

    This study addresses multiple research questions as part of a
broader investigation into housing affordability and accessibility in
Georgia, with a primary focus on the first research question:

1.  What is the relationship between demographic, geographic, and
    economic features collected by the Census Bureau's American
    Community Survey and the percentage of owner- and renter-occupied
    housing that is classified as cost-burdened (e.g., 30% of their
    income dedicated to housing costs)?

2.  What demographic, geographic, and economic features collected in the
    Census Bureau's American Community Survey influence the housing mix
    (e.g., owner-occupied, renter-occupied, owner-vacant, and
    renter-vacant) in each geographical area in Georgia?

3.  Is there a statistically driven and reliable index or indices that
    provides a comprehensive understanding of housing availability,
    accessibility, and affordability that highlights a geographic area's
    housing security or insecurity, similar to the concept of food
    deserts?

## Data Description

    The data for this project is sourced from the ACS which is conducted
by the U.S. Census Bureau. The ACS collects data continuously throughout
the year, with approximately 3.5 million households surveyed annually.
This large sample size allows the survey to generate reliable estimates
for all types of communities in Georgia. Households are selected using a
random sampling method, ensuring that all areas are represented. Data
collected from the sampled households are then weighted by the Census
Bureau to account for demographic and geographic differences, allowing
the survey to produce accurate estimates that are representative of the
entire population of Georgia. The demographic data collected by the
survey focuses on topics such as income, housing, education, employment,
transportation, and more. Contrary to the decennial census where
everyone is counted the ACS surveys a sample of households each year and
uses that data and their own methods to extrapolate that data to
represent total populations of the United States.

    The two main estimates used in this analysis are 1--Year and 5-Year
estimates. The 1--Year estimates are straightforward and are only
estimates for that year. On the other hand the 5--Year estimates are a
bit different in that they represent a 5 year period such as 2017--2021.
Rather than summing data from each year, the Census Bureau averages it
to produce an estimate that reflects a typical year within the period.

    The data are split into multiple tables each focusing on specific
demographic information. For example, separate tables detail cost-burden
for owner-occupied and renter occupied housing and are further broken
down by various race categories, age groups, and other demographic
features. In addition to using the ACS data as presented by the U.S.
Census Bureau, a separate aggregated dataset was created specifically
for this analysis. The dataset we used was constructed using the 2023
ACS 5-Year estimates and contains 159 rows corresponding to each county
in Georgia. The dataset includes a variety of variables (listed in Table
1) that capture demographic, economic, and housing-related information
across geographic regions.

    When exploring census data, there are many tables with row values
marked "not computed." This is often a result of incomplete information
provided by individuals or households. The official census documentation
advises removing rows with "not computed" values, but the aggregated
dataset did not include any of such values. Instead, as a result of the
computations used to obtain certain columns in the aggregated set, new
NA values were introduced. Figure 1 shows a histogram of the missingness
present in the new aggregated dataset. These NA values function as zero,
but were labeled as NA due to special circumstances in which
calculations involved dividing by zero. Thus, these NA values were
replaced by zeroes, and there is no further missingness present.

    The analysis was conducted using *R* [@base] with an emphasis on the
use of the *tidycensus* [@tidycensus] package, which simplifies
accessing the ACS data by connecting to Census Bureau API. The API
allows for users to directly retrieve data into R. This package
facilitates data wrangling tasks, such as filtering and aggregating
variables. Along with that *tidycensus* integrates with visualization
libraries in R, allowing for seamless creation of maps and charts to
illustrate housing burden trends across the various regions of Georgia.
Instead of summing up data from each year, the Census Bureau averages
the data to produce an estimate that reflects a typical year within the
5-year period

    To provide proper context for the forthcoming analysis, it is
important to first consider the summary statistics of the overall
demographics of Georgia. The plot of median income in Georgia (Figure 2)
highlights the income disparity across the state, with the highest
median incomes centered around metro Atlanta, while the more rural
regions display notably lower median incomes.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Median Household Income (2020)", fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
options(tigris_use_cache = TRUE)

ga <- get_acs(
  state = "GA",
  geography = "tract",
  variables = "B19013_001",
  geometry = TRUE,
  year = 2020,
  cache_table = TRUE,
  progress = FALSE
)

ga %>%
  ggplot(aes(fill = estimate)) + 
  geom_sf(color = NA) + 
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "magma") + ggtitle("Median Household Income in Georgia")
```

    Next, the plot of housing cost burden by county (Figure 3) reveals
the distribution of cost-burdened housing across different geographic
regions in Georgia. Figure 3 displays that housing cost burden is
distributed rather evenly across the state, regardless of the median
income of the respective area. The concentration of higher median
incomes in metropolitan areas is expected; however, areas of higher
median income do not appear to correspond with lower levels of housing
burden. This suggests that rising housing costs in cities may create
affordability challenges even for higher earning households. The data
was processed using *dplyr* [@dplyr] for data manipulation and tools
from *tigris* [@tigris] for spatial plots. Additionally, *ggplot2*
[@ggplot2] was used for data visualization. Lastly, *sf* [@sf] was used
for managing geospatial objects. The packages *dplyr* and *ggplot2* come
from *tidyverse* [@tidyverse], a collection of R packages for data
manipulation, visualization and other tasks.

    When examining population and income by race (Figures 4 & 5),
economic and demographic inequities become more pronounced. White
populations make up the largest demographic, appearing spread out across
the state, with a notable absence in urban Atlanta. Black populations
also make up a large proportion of the population, but tend to
concentrate in urban Atlanta, as well as central and southern regions of
Georgia. Hispanic and Asian populations, on the other hand, make up
lower proportions of the population and are centered primarily around
metro Atlanta. The plot of median income by race displays the greatest
median household incomes in White households, particularly in suburban
areas, while Black and Hispanic households consistently report lower
median household incomes. The Asian population tends to have greater
median household incomes on average in comparison to Black and Hispanic
populations, but this wealth is generally centered around metro Atlanta.
The income and population disparities present in the plots emphasize the
greater vulnerability to housing insecurity for Black and Hispanic
households.

    A closer examination of the plots of burdened homeowners and renters
by race (Figures 6 and 7) accentuates the racial inequity present in
Figures 5. These plots display the mean percentage of cost-burdened
owners and renters across Georgia's 159 counties.Among homeowners, Black
homeowners and renters account for the greatest mean percentage of cost
burdened housing. In contrast White homeowners have the lowest mean
percentage and White renters and Other renters have about the same mean.
These findings suggest that there may exist systemic barriers, such as
wage gaps and discriminatory housing practices, that disproportionately
affect minority communities. Particularly, renters face rising
challenges due to increasing rental costs and a lack of affordable
housing options in both rural and metropolitan areas.

    The addition of age adds another layer of complexity to the
analysis. As seen in the plots of the mean percentage of cost-burdened
homeowners and renters by age across Georgia's 159 counties (Figure 8 &
9), households of those aged 15--24 experience the greatest levels of
cost burden, for both renters and homeowners. A simple explanatory
hypothesis is that lower ages correlate with a lower income,
specifically amongst entry-level workers. Homeowners over the age of 65
also face greater levels of housing burden. This is possibly a result of
fixed retirement incomes, as well as rising property taxes.

    To better understand the nature of the selected data, a correlation
heatmap was created (Figure 10). As seen in Figure 10, median household
income is fairly correlated with the percentage of White cost-burdened
renters (0.46), the percentage of cost-burdened renters from ages 15-24
(0.31), and the percentage of cost-burdened renters above the age of 65
(0.38). These correlations indicate that areas of greater median
household income may also correspond with a greater percentage of
burdened White renters, 15-24 year old renters, and greater than 65 year
old renters. In addition, there are substantial correlations between
cost-burdened 35-64 year olds and cost-burdened White homeowners (0.52),
cost-burdened renters aged 15-24 years old and cost-burdened White
renters (0.53), cost=burdened renters aged 35-64 years old and cost
burdened White renters (0.45), and cost-burdened renters aged 35-64
years old and cost-burdened Black renters (0.56), suggesting that when
certain demographics face housing cost burden in a certain county, it is
likely that other demographics will also face cost burden. Extrapolating
this insight, it is inferred that there may be other factors---such as
property taxes, real estate market conditions, supply of affordable
rental units, etc.---that influence housing cost burden and affect
multiple demographics similarly. It should be noted that there is a
strong correlation (0.81) between median household income and percentage
of bachelor's degrees or higher.

![Correlation Heatmap](corrmap.png){width="80%"}

    The initial analysis of the census datum reveal that rising housing
cost burden in Georgia may come as a result of a complex, multivariate
interaction of variables such as income, race, geography, age, etc.
While less populated areas face housing cost challenges due to low
incomes, it is evident that highly populated areas are also becoming
increasingly impacted by housing costs. Minorities, mainly Black and
Hispanic households, are disproportionately affected by housing cost
burden, indicating potential systemic inequities. Younger and older
renters/homeowners are also vulnerable to these challenges, suggesting
that focused intervention may be necessary to tackle the growing issue
of housing affordability. The package gridExtra [@gridExtra] was used
for arranging multiple plots on a single panel.

## Methods

    To answer the questions posed by clients, several tools were
utilized to better understand the relationships between economic,
geographic, and demographic predictor variables in the context of
predicting cost-burden percentage for both owner-occupied households and
renter-occupied households. The analysis was conducted at the county
level for the state of Georgia, meaning each observation in the dataset
represented a specific county, allowing for the assessment of regional
trends and differences.

### Multiple Linear Regression

    The analysis began with the application of a multiple linear
regression model to predict the cost-burden percentage for
owner-occupied households. The model equation is:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\text{Pct\_CostBurdened\_Owners}_i &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{isUrban}_i + \beta_2 \cdot \text{MedHouseIncome}_i \\
&\quad + \beta_3 \cdot \text{Pct\_Bachelors\_Higher}_i + \beta_4 \cdot \text{Unemployment\_Rate}_i + \epsilon_i
\end{split}
\end{equation}

where *Pct_CostBurdened_Owners* is the dependent variable and *isUrban*, *MedHouseIncome*, *Pct_Bachelors_Higher*, and *Unemployment_Rate* are the predictor variables defined in Table 1.

    To address potential heterodescasticity present within the model,
the Breusch-Pagan test conducted as a diagnostic check. Upon detecting
evidence of heterodescasticity, a log-transformation on the dependent
variable was used to stabalize the variance in the residuals.
Additionally, cross-fold valuation was employed to compare performance
between the original multiple linear regression model and the
log-transformed model. Root means squared error and prediction accuaracy
were metrics used to evaluate performance for model selection. The
log-transformed model equation is:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\log(\text{Pct\_CostBurdened\_Owners}_i) &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{isUrban}_i + \beta_2 \cdot \text{MedHouseIncome}_i \\
&\quad + \beta_3 \cdot \text{Pct\_Bachelors\_Higher}_i + \beta_4 \cdot \text{Unemployment\_Rate}_i + \epsilon_i
\end{split}
\end{equation}

where *log(Pct_CostBurdened_Owners)* is the dependent variable and *isUrban*, *MedHouseIncome*, *Pct_Bachelors_Higher*, and *Unemployment_Rate* are the predictor variables defined in Table 1.

    Once the conditions were met --- including checking for assumptions
for model-fitting (such as linearity, independence, normality of
residuals, and constant variance within residuals) --- backward
selection utilizing AIC criterion was used to assess variable selection.
After deciding on a final model, the significance of each predictor on
the dependent variable was evaluated using p-values at a 5% level of
significance. Additionally, multicollinearity was checked using Variance
Inflation Factors (VIF). The effects, whether positive or negative, as
well as the extent to which the owner-occupied cost-burden percentage
was affected, were analyzed in terms of the coefficient values of the
predictors. Model performance was measured using R-squared and adjusted
R-squared values, and possible interaction effects between predictor
variables were tested to determine any combined influences on cost
burden.

    The second model applied was a multiple linear regression model
analyzing the effects of the previously mentioned predictors on the
cost-burden percentage for renter-occupied households. After fitting the
model, conditions were checked similarly to the previous analysis. The
model failed the constant variance condition, due to the presence of a
statistically significant p-value at a 5% level of significance using
the Breusch-Pagan test. To attempt to fix the problem of
heteroscedasticity present within the model, an outlier point was
removed from the data set and the model was refitted. This did not fix
the problem of heteroscedasticity, due to the presence of a more
statistically significant p-value using the Breusch-Pagan test. The
renter cost-burden model equation is:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\text{Pct\_CostBurdened\_Renters}_i &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{isUrban}_i + \beta_2 \cdot \text{MedHouseIncome}_i \\
&\quad + \beta_3 \cdot \text{Pct\_Bachelors\_Higher}_i + \beta_4 \cdot \text{Unemployment\_Rate}_i + \epsilon_i
\end{split}
\end{equation}

where *Pct_CostBurdened_Renters* is the dependent variable and *isUrban*, *MedHouseIncome*, *Pct_Bachelors_Higher*, and *Unemployment_Rate* are the predictor variables defined in Table 1.


     A log-transformation was applied to the original multiple linear
regression model, without removing the outlier point. The
log-transformed model failed the Breusch-Pagan test due to a
statistically significant p-value at a 5% level of significance,
indicating heteroscedasticity. Additionally, the normality condition was
violated, as evidenced by skewness in the histogram of residuals and the
failure of the Shapiro-Wilk test, where the p-value was below a 5% level
of significance, indicating a rejection of the null hypothesis of
normality. An attempt was made at refitting the log-transformed model by
removing the outlier point, but it still resulted in the same conclusion
and did not improve on checking regression assumptions. The
log-transformed renter cost-burden model equation is:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\log(\text{Pct\_CostBurdened\_Renters}_i) &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{isUrban}_i + \beta_2 \cdot \text{MedHouseIncome}_i \\
&\quad + \beta_3 \cdot \text{Pct\_Bachelors\_Higher}_i + \beta_4 \cdot \text{Unemployment\_Rate}_i + \epsilon_i
\end{split}
\end{equation}

where *log(Pct_CostBurdened_Renters)* is the dependent variable and *isUrban*, *MedHouseIncome*, *Pct_Bachelors_Higher*, and *Unemployment_Rate* are the predictor variables defined in Table 1.

### Weighted Least Squares Regression

    To address this problem, an ordinary least squares model was deemed
inappropriate due to the potential for biased and inaccurate coefficient
estimates. Instead, a weighted least squares regression model was
applied, which adjusts for heteroscedasticity by assigning different
weights to different observations based on a chosen factor. The
*isUrban* variable was selected as the weighting factor, as going from a
rural county to a urban county significantly increased cost-burden for
renter-occupied households. This approach also had a significant impact
on the coefficients for the other factors in the model. The application
of this method stabilized the heteroscedasticity in the residuals, and
the model met all necessary regression assumptions. The weighted least
squares model equations are:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\text{Pct\_CostBurdened\_Renters}_i &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{isUrban}_i 
+ \beta_2 \cdot \text{MedHouseIncome}_i \\
&\quad + \beta_3 \cdot \text{Pct\_Bachelors\_Higher}_i 
+ \beta_4 \cdot \text{Unemployment\_Rate}_i + \epsilon_i
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\text{Var}(\epsilon_i) = \sigma^2_{j}, \quad \text{for} \quad j \in \{\text{Urban}, \text{Non-Urban}\}
\end{equation}

\noindent
\textbf{where:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{isUrban}, \textit{MedHouseIncome}, \textit{Pct\_Bachelors\_Higher}, and \textit{Unemployment\_Rate} are defined in Table 1.
    \item $\sigma^2_j$ represents the distinct error variance for urban and non-urban counties.
\end{itemize}

    After ensuring conditions were met, backward selection was used
incorporating BIC criterion for variable selection. Then, after getting
a final model, the significance of each predictor variable on the
cost-burden percentage for renter-occupied households was evaluated
using p-values and confidence intervals. Multicollinearity was checked
using Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) to ensure that variables were not
correlated. Model fit was assessed using R-squared and adjusted
R-squared values. Additionally, possible interaction effects between
predictor variables were tested to determine any combined influences on
cost burden.

    At the request of the client, separate models were analyzed for
predicting cost-burden percentages for renter-occupied and
owner-occupied households at the county level. This approach was taken
to capture the distinct effects of various factors, as these effects can
differ significantly between renters and owners.

### Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

    Before conducting statistical analyses, the assumptions underlying
analysis of variance (ANOVA) were carefully examined to ensure the
validity of the results. Specifically, we assessed the assumptions of
normality, independence, and homogeneity of variance. Normality within
groups was evaluated using diagnostic plots and the Shapiro-Wilks test,
which indicated that the distribution of cost-burdened housing
percentages did not significantly deviate from normality. However,
Levene's test for homogeneity of variance revealed violations of the
equal variance assumption across groups.

    Given that normality was reasonably satisfied but homogeneity of
variance was not, we selected Welch's ANOVA as the appropriate
statistical test. Unlike the standard one-way ANOVA, Welch's ANOVA is
robust to unequal variances while still assuming normality, making it a
suitable alternative under these conditions.

    For the demographic analysis, four separate one-way Welch's ANOVAs
were conducted to compare differences in cost-burdened housing
percentages across age and race groups, for both owner-occupied and
renter-occupied housing. Age groups were categorized as 15--24, 25--34,
35--64, and 65+. For race, categories included White, Black, and Other.

```

### Multiple Linear Regression

    The resulting model uses a linear model to predict the log of cost
burden of owner-occupied housing using median household income and
percent of population with a bachelor's degree as predictors. The model
was found to be statistically significant with a p-value of
approximately 0.0001. The equation is as follows:

\begin{equation}
\log(\text{Pct\_CostBurdened\_Owners}) = 3.167 - 0.000006972 \cdot \text{MedHouseIncome} + 0.009859 \cdot \text{Pct\_Bachelors\_Higher}
\end{equation}

For every \$1,000 increase in median household income, there's a 0.0007%
decrease in cost-burdenedness for owner-occupied households. For every
1% increase in people with a bachelor's degree or higher, there's a
0.9908% increase in cost-burden for owner-occupied households. These
results suggest that higher median household income is associated with
reduced housing cost burden, while a higher percentage of individuals
with a bachelor's degree or higher is associated with increased housing
cost burden among owner-occupied households.

### Weighted Least Squares Regression

    A similar multiple linear regression model was fit to predict the
percentage of renter-occupied cost-burdened households based on the same
predictors as the owner-occupied model. However, after examining the
residuals through a Breusch-Pagan test, there is evidence of
heteroscedasticity, BP = 11.52, p = 0.021.

```

    Several transformations, such as removing residual outliers and log
transforming the data, were performed to address challenges with
non-constant variance in the residuals, but strong evidence of
heteroscedasticity remained. Thus, a weighted least squares (WLS) model
was deployed instead. It was hypothesized that variability of percent
renter-occupied cost-burdened households may differ across urban and
rural counties, which is reflected by the chosen weighting function.
(Several different weighting options were tested, and weighting based on
urban or rural county provided the most reliable performance, while
meeting all underlying assumptions). It should also be noted that the
unemployment rate predictor was removed to reduce multicollinearity and
achieve a better BIC (decreased from 1151.61 to 1148.88). Cross
validation and backward selection were employed to produce the final
model.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\text{Pct\_CostBurdened\_Renters} &= 28.705 + 9.429 \cdot \text{isUrban} \\
                                  &\quad - 0.00015 \cdot \text{MedHouseIncome} \\
                                  &\quad + 0.351 \cdot \text{Pct\_Bachelors\_Higher}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

where:

\begin{equation}
  Var(\epsilon_i) = 
  \begin{cases}
    \sigma^2 & \text{if } isUrban_i = 0 \\
    \theta^2\sigma^2 & \text{if } isUrban_i = 1
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\clearpage

Thus, the model minimizes the expression:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\sum_{i=1}^n \left(\frac{1}{\operatorname{Var}(\epsilon_i)}\right) \Biggl(y_i - \biggl[ 
&\beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{isUrban}_i \\
&\quad + \beta_2 \cdot \text{MedHouseIncome}_i \\
&\quad + \beta_3 \cdot \text{Pct\_Bachelors\_Higher}_i \biggr] \Biggr)^2
\end{split}
\end{equation}

where:

\begin{equation}
  w_i = 
  \begin{cases}
    \frac{1}{\sigma^2} & \text{if } isUrban_i = 0 \\
    \frac{1}{\theta^2\sigma^2} & \text{if } isUrban_i = 1
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

This weighting criterion ensures that the isUrban factor level with
larger residual variance gets less weight in the estimation.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# WLS Renter-occupied Cost Burden
wls_renters <- gls(percent_renter_occupied_cost_burdened ~ isUrban + MedHouseIncome + percent_bachelors_higher,

                 weights = varIdent(form = ~ 1 | isUrban))

summary(wls_renters)
summary(wls_renters)$tTable
```

    Specifically, weighting by urban or rural counties allows the model
to fix a baseline standard deviation of 1.00 for rural counties, while
the standard deviation for urban areas was assigned to 0.65. This
effectively handles heteroscedasticity by reducing residual variation
within urban counties, in comparison with rural counties. Examining the
residuals for the WLS model with a Breusch-Pagan test, the
heteroscedasticity was properly handled, BP = 0.10235, p-value = 0.797.

```

    Table 3 shows the coefficients, standard errors, t-values, and
p-values for the final WLS model. All of the predictors are
statistically significant. As a result, the null hypothesis (there is no
correlation between individual predictors and the percentage of
renter-occupied cost-burdened households) can be rejected. Additionally,
when median household income and education level are held constant,
urban counties display a 9.43% increase in renter-occupied housing cost
burden, relative to rural counties. This supports the original
hypothesis that urban counties are associated with greater percentages
of renter-occupied cost-burdened households. Furthermore, every \$1000
increase in median household income correlates with a 0.153% decrease in
renter-occupied housing cost burden, when all other variables are held
constant. In practical terms, greater median incomes are linked with a
slightly lower percentage of renter-occupied cost-burdened households.
Another notable finding is that every 1% increase in the population
holding bachelor's degrees correlates with a 0.35% increase in
renter-occupied housing cost burden. This finding provides support
against a logical hypothesis that greater percentages of formal higher
education in a population correlates with a lower percentage of
households being labeled as cost-burdened.

    A Welch’s one-way ANOVA was conducted to examine mean differences in
the percentage of cost-burdened housing across age groups (15–24, 25–34,
35–64, and 65+) for both owner-occupied and renter-occupied housing. The
analysis was performed at a significance level of $\alpha$= 0.05.

    For owner-occupied housing, this analysis revealed a statistically
significant effect of age group on the percentage of cost-burdened
housing, F = 23.43, p \< .0001. This shows that the mean percentage of
cost-burdened housing differs meaningfully between at least one of the
age groups, based on statistically significant evidence. Pairwise
comparisons using the Games-Howell test indicated that the percentage of
cost-burdened housing for the age groups 15-24 differed significantly
with the age groups 25-34 and 35-64 with p-values of .00504 and .00027
respectively. Age group 65+ also differed significantly with age groups
25-34 and 35-64 with p-values of .00367 and \<.001 respectively. Age
groups 25-34 and 35-64 did not differ significantly with a p-value of
.43913. Age groups 15-24 and 65+ did differ significantly with a p value
.00504. Due to age groups 15-24 and 65+ having higher means than age
groups 25-34 and 35-64 indicates that ages 15-24 and 65+ are more like
to experience cost-burden and since age 15-24 has the highest mean its
the most likely to experience it.

    For renter-occupied housing, Welch's ANOVA also revealed a
significant effect of age group on the percentage of cost-burdened
housing, F = 7.51, p \< 0.001. This indicates that the mean percentage of
cost-burdened housing differs significantly between at least one of the
age groups. Pairwise comparisons using the Games-Howell test indicated
that the percentage of cost-burdened housing for age group 65+ differed
significantly with the age groups 15-24, 25-34, and 35-64 with p values
.0431, .0021, and \< 0.001 respectively. No significant differences were
observed between other age groups. This suggests that the 65+ renters
are more likely to experience cost-burdened housing compared to younger
renters as they had a higher mean (see Tables 7, and 8,9,10 for details).

    Welch's ANOVA was also performed to examine differences in the
percentage of cost-burdened housing across race groups for both
owner-occupied and renter-occupied housing. As with the age groups,
Welch's ANOVA was used due to violations of the assumption of equal
variances. The analysis was conducted at a significance level of
$\alpha$ = 0.05.

    For owner-occupied housing, the analysis indicated a significant
effect of race group on the percentage of cost-burdened housing, F =
31.20, p \< .001. This suggests that the mean percentage of
cost-burdened housing differs significantly across race groups. Pairwise
comparisons using the Games-Howell test showed that the Black group
differed significantly from the White group with a p-value \<.0001 and
did not differ significantly from the Other group with a p-value of
.365. Additionally, the White group was found to differ significantly
from the Other group with a p value of .031. Also, the Black group had
the highest mean followed by the Other group which indicates that Black
owners and Other owners are more likely to experience cost-burden than
White owners.

    For renter-occupied housing, Welch's ANOVA also showed a significant
effect of race group on the percentage of cost-burdened housing, F =
18.08, p \< .001. This suggests that the mean percentage of
cost-burdened housing differs significantly across race groups for
renters. Pairwise comparisons using the Games-Howell test indicated that
the Black group differed significantly from the White and Other groups
with p-values \<.0001 and .0011 respectively. It also showed the White
group did not differ significantly from the Other group with a p-value
of .9832. These results indicate that Black renters are more likely to
experience cost-burden than the White and Other groups as they have a
higher mean (see Tables 11,12,13,14 for details)

## Conclusion

This analysis of housing cost burden in Georgia revealed several
meaningful insights into the geographical, economic, and demographic
factors that influence cost burden for both owner-occupied and
renter-occupied households. Remarkable findings include that urban
counties exhibit a 9.43% increase in cost-burden for renter-occupied
households as compared to rural counties. Median household income and
education levels are also key drivers for influencing cost-burden for
owner-occupied households: higher household income levels correlate with
a slight reduction in cost-burden (0.0007%), while unexpectedly higher
education levels correlate with a slight increase in cost-burden
(0.9908%). Meanwhile, for renter-occupied households, higher education
levels also correlate with a slight increase in cost-burden (0.351%).
These findings suggest that while higher education may lead to higher
paying jobs, rising housing costs in urban counties may be offesetting
gains in earning potential.

The analysis revealed that both age and race are significantly
associated with differences in the mean percentage of cost-burdened
housing for owner-occupied and renter-occupied households. For
owner-occupied housing, younger adults (15–24) and older adults (65+)
were significantly more likely to be cost-burdened compared to
middle-aged groups (25–34) and (35-64), with the 15–24 age group showing
the highest cost burden. Racial disparities were also present, with
Black and Other homeowners experiencing higher cost burdens than White
homeowners. For renter-occupied housing, adults aged 65+ were
significantly more likely to be cost-burdened compared to all other age
groups. Looking back into race, Black renters showed a significantly
higher cost burden than both White and Other groups, highlighting a
notable disparity.

These methodological approaches, including both weighted least squares
regression and Welch's ANOVA, effectively addressed challenges such as
heterodescasticity and unequal variances, allowing for more robust
results. These models suggest need for intervention from policy-makers,
such as expanding affordable housing options for more cost-burdened
individuals in urban areas, implementing rent stabilization measures,
and addressing wage discrepancies. Further research could explore
additional variables or ways to handle spatially correlated data, based
on county level, to further refine these insights.

In summary, this analysis provides practical evidence for policymakers
to address housing insecurity in Georgia, emphasizing urgent need for
equitable solutions specifically tailored to most affected demographics
(i.e. urban renters, Black households, and vulnerable age groups). By
addressing these disparities, Georgia can move toward a better housing
future.
